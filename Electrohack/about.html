                PTSD can develop after exposure to a traumatic event and is characterized by re-experiencing the trauma through
                intrusive memories, flashbacks, or nightmares. Individuals with PTSD may avoid reminders of the traumatic event
                and experience negative changes in mood and thinking. Hyperarousal symptoms, such as irritability, difficulty
                sleeping, and an exaggerated startle response, contribute to the overall distress associated with the disorder.
                PTSD can significantly impact an individual's daily life and relationships, often requiring professional
                intervention for effective management.
