        <h2>What is Bipolar Disorder ? </h2>
        <p> Bipolar disorder is a mental health problem that mainly affects your mood. If you have bipolar disorder, you’re likely to have times where you experience:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Manic or hypomanic episodes, which means feeling high. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Depressive episodes, which means feeling low.
            </li>
            <li>
                Potentially some psychotic symptoms during manic or depressive episodes. 
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p> You might hear these different experiences called mood episodes or states. Mood episodes can range from severe depression, to mania and anything in between. Sometimes your episodes may feel intense and other times you may feel stable. And you may never experience certain mood episodes. For example, not everyone with bipolar disorder will experience mania.

        <h2>What causes Bipolar Disorder?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <span>
                    Childhood trauma: 
                </span>
                Some experts believe that experiencing a lot of emotional distress as a child can cause bipolar disorder to develop. This could be because childhood trauma and distress can have a big effect on your ability to manage your emotions. This can include experiences like: neglect, sexual, physical or emotional abuse, traumatic events or because of losing someone very close to you, such as a parent or carer.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>
                    Stressful life events:
                </span>
                You may be able to link the start of your symptoms to stressful experiences or situations in your life. Some people also find that stress can trigger a mood episode. Or it may make symptoms feel more intense or difficult to manage.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>
                     Brain chemistry:
                </span>
                Evidence shows that you can treat bipolar symptoms with certain psychiatric medications which act on the neurotransmitters. These are the 'messenger chemicals' in your brain. This suggests that bipolar disorder may relate to functional problems of the neurotransmitters. While some research supports this, no one knows for sure how these neurotransmitters work. And we don’t know whether problems with these are a cause of bipolar disorder, or a result of it.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>
                    Family links:
                </span>
                If you experience bipolar disorder, you’re more likely to have a family member who also experiences bipolar moods and symptoms. But they might not have an official diagnosis. This suggests that bipolar disorder can be passed on genetically through families. However, this doesn’t strictly mean that there is one 'bipolar gene'. Family links are likely to be much more complex. For example, researchers think that social factors can also trigger experiences of bipolar disorder symptoms. And family members can be an influential part of your environment as you grow up.

                    Medication, drugs and alcohol:
                </span>
                Medication, drugs and alcohol may cause you to experience some bipolar moods and symptoms. For example: Some medications can cause hypomania or mania as a side effect. This can happen when you're taking them or as a withdrawal symptom when you stop taking them. This includes medications for physical conditions and psychiatric medications – including some antidepressants. Depression can also be a side effect of a lot of different medications. It's important to discuss any concerns about medication side effects with your doctor.

        <h2>What does living with bipolar feels like?</h2>
        <p>"It's an emotional amplifier: when my mood is high I feel far quicker, funnier, smarter and livelier than anyone; when my mood is low I take on the suffering of the whole world."</p>
        <p> We all have changes in our mood, but in bipolar disorder these changes can feel very distressing and have a big impact on your life. You may feel that your high and low moods are extreme, and that swings in your mood are overwhelming. And you may feel and behave very differently, depending on your mood. This can be difficult and confusing.</p>

                    Mixed episodes:
                </span>
                A mixed episode can be particularly difficult to cope with, as it - can be harder to work out what you're feeling, can be harder to identify what help you need or you might find managing your emotions harder and more exhausting, your friends, family or doctor might struggle to know how to best support you, and you may be more likely to act on suicidal thoughts and feelings.
                <p>
                    Psychotic symptoms can include:
                    • Delusions, such as paranoia

                • Worried about becoming unwell again

                • Unsure about whether to continue with medication or other treatment

        <h2>How often do Bipolar Episodes occur?</h2>
        <p> Bipolar episodes happen at different times for different people. The frequency can depend on a lot of things, such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Your exact bipolar disorder diagnosis.  
            </li>
            <li>
                How well you're able to manage your symptoms.
            </li>
            <li>
                How you'd personally define an episode.  
            </li>
            <li>
                Whether certain situations or experiences can trigger episodes. For example, you might find that sleeping very little or going through a stressful life event could trigger a manic episode. 
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p> The length of mood episodes can also vary. They can last for a few weeks or much  longer. What’s normal for you can also change over time.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section id="diagnosis">
        <h2>How long does diagnosis take?</h2>
        <p>As bipolar disorder involves changes in your moods over time, your doctor may want to observe you for a while before making a diagnosis. 
            Your doctor will want to be careful that they give you the correct diagnosis. Bipolar disorder has some symptoms in common with other mental health problems, such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Depression </li>
                <li>Borderline personality disorder (BPD)</li>
                <li>Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)</li>
                <li>Schizoaffective disorder</li>
                <li>Schizophrenia </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Because of this, it might take a long time to get a correct diagnosis – sometimes it can take years.</p>

        <h2>Treatment for Bipolar Disorder</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>
