        <h2>What is Schizophrenia? </h2>
        <p>  Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness that affects how a person thinks, feels, and behaves. People with schizophrenia may seem like they have lost touch with reality, which can be distressing for them and for their family and friends. The symptoms of schizophrenia can make it difficult to participate in usual, everyday activities, but effective treatments are available. Many people who receive treatment can engage in school or work, achieve independence, and enjoy personal relationships.

        <h2>What do people with schizrophenia feel?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <span>
                    Hallucinations:
                </span>
                People with schizophrenia might hear, see, smell, or feel things no one else does.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <span>
                    Delusions:
                </span>
                These are beliefs that seem strange to most people and are easy to prove wrong. The person affected might think someone is trying to control their brain through TVs or that the FBI is out to get them. They might believe they're someone else, like a famous actor or the president, or that they have superpowers.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <span>
                    Trouble concentrating: 
                </span>
                For example, someone might lose track of what's going on in a TV show as they're watching.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <span>
                    Movement disorders: 
                </span>
                Some people with schizophrenia can seem jumpy. Sometimes they'll make the same movements over and over again. But sometimes they might be perfectly still for hours at a stretch, which experts call being catatonic. Contrary to popular belief, people with the disease usually aren't violent.

        <h2>How can I help myself?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Try to have a good relationship with the professionals involved in your care. Be honest and open. This will make it easier for them to understand and help you.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li>
                When you and your doctor have found the medication and dose that works best for you, keep taking it – don’t skip doses or give up.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Learn to recognise the signs that you could be having a relapse. Pay attention to changes in your body and in your thinking. Tell your mental health team or psychiatrist as soon as possible if you think something is going wrong.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Ask your case manager/key worker or psychiatrist to help you make a plan about how to deal with early signs of relapse. You can ask your close friends and family to help you if this happens.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li>
                It is very important that you attend all of your appointments. You will need to have health check-ups and screening tests to help you look after your physical health.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Keep in touch with your friends. Nurture all the positive relationships in your life.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Be optimistic about your future. You can live with schizophrenia, and live well as you recover.
            </li>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <span>Psychotherapy: </span>
            </li>
            Talk therapy methods like cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) can help you cope with and manage your condition. Long-term therapy can also help with secondary problems alongside schizophrenia, such as anxiety, depression or substance use issues.
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <span>Antipsychotics:</span>
            </li>
            These medications block how your brain uses certain chemicals for cell-to-cell communication.
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <span>Other medications: </span>
            </li>
            Your healthcare provider might also prescribe other medications to symptoms that happen alongside or because of your schizophrenia symptoms. They might also prescribe medications to help reduce side effects of antipsychotic medications such as tremors.
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <span>Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT):</span>
            </li>
            If other treatments don’t work, your provider may recommend ECT. This treatment involves using an electrical current applied to your scalp, which then stimulates certain parts of your brain. The stimulation causes a brief seizure, which can help improve brain function if you have severe depression, agitation and other problems. If you have ECT, you receive anesthesia. You’ll be asleep for this procedure and won’t feel any pain
        </ul>
