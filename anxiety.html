        <h2>What is Anxiety?</h2>
        <p> Anxiety is a word we use for fears about the threat of something going wrong in the future, rather than right now.<br>
            Anxiety can last for a short time and then pass when whatever was causing you worry is over, but it can also last much longer and disrupt your life. Ongoing anxiety can affect your ability to eat, sleep, or concentrate.
            Some people become overwhelmed by fear and want to avoid situations that might make them frightened or anxious.

        <h2>What makes you Anxious</h2>
        <p>The word ‘anxiety’ tends to be used to describe worry, or when fear persists over time, often without any one cause. Anxiety is when fear is about something in the future or something that might happen, rather than what is happening right now. The ways that you feel when you’re frightened and anxious are very similar, as the basic emotion is the same.

        <h2>PANIC ATTACK</h2>
        <p>A panic attack is when you feel overwhelmed by the physical and mental feelings of fear.
            People who have panic attacks say that they find it hard to breathe, and they may worry that they’re having a heart attack or are going to lose control of their body.

        <h2>How do i know if i need help?</h2>
        <p>
            Fear and anxiety is something that we will all experience now and then. It is only when it is severe and long-lasting that it can become a mental health problem.
            If you feel anxious all the time for several weeks, if it feels like your fears or phobias are taking over your life, or if you’re experiencing panic attacks, it’s a good idea to ask your doctor for help.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some people feel a constant sense of  anxiety all the time, without any particular trigger. There are plenty of triggers for fear in everyday life, and you can’t always work out exactly why you are frightened or how likely you are to be harmed. Even if you can know how out of proportion a fear is, the emotional part of your brain keeps sending danger signals to your body. Sometimes you need mental and physical ways of tackling fear and anxiety.
